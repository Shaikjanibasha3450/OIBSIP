- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
- Species (Target variable)

## Objective
Build and train classification models to accurately predict iris species based on flower measurements.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization

## Implementation
The notebook contains complete implementation of:
- Data loading and exploration
- Data preprocessing
- Feature scaling
- Model training (multiple algorithms)
- Model evaluation
- Cross-validation
- Performance metrics

## Results
Accuracy and performance metrics for different classification algorithms.
